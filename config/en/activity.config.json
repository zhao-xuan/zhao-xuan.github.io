It’s a gesture-based cursor control application that allows you to operate your devices without using a trackpad or a mouse. You can open/close a tab in Chrome, or drag a window around using a click and drag gesture, as well as scrolling a webpage and even take a screenshot. Thanks to Zelin (Daniel) Deng‘s smoothing algorithm, Sudarshan Sreeram’s beautiful icon design, and the configuration of ratio aspect of camera and screen, the control is quite precise and is able to cover the entire screen. Thanks to Gavin Wu’s professional video shooting and editing skills, we produced the demo video below to showcase how Magic Wand can be used. In the end, we are able to use it to perform usual mouse behaviours of clicking and dragging, playing games such as Fruit Ninja and Geometry Dash, drawing a binary tree in an online meeting, as well as playing the Google #quickdraw in a browser.",
