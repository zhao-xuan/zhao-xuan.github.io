  "content": "Hi, there! I'm <span>Tom Zhao</span> and I just graduated from Imperial College London Department of Computing this year. Originally from Inner Mongol, China, I spent 3 years of high school in the Bar Area and now I’m here in London, seeking to continue my journey in computer science and technology industry, with a focus on math/statistics, reinforcement learning, graphics, and robotics. In my spare time I love to go for running, mountain or road biking, badminton, and traveling. See the list of cities I’ve been to here. For now, I will join Microsoft UK as a full-time software engineer and try to figure out what's the next step for my life. Any connection is welcomed :D",
